# KohaReadSuggestion

This Koha Plugin is an attempt at creating a "crowd-sourced" suggestion engine.<br>
For a given Biblionumber reference it gives the 10 top issued references.<br>
Similar references are then linked to each others by patron issues.<br>

## To install the plugin
First you have to modify koha-conf.xml and set enableplugins to 1 (it is set to 0 by default).<br>
Then check in Koha Administration panel, search for the UseKohaPlugins variable, and set this to Enable.<br>
Finally go to the Reports panel and click on "Report Plugins".<br>
On the top left corner you'll see an "Upload a plugin" link, which will enable you to install the KPZ file.<br>

## How to use
Easy! Click on "Run report" and type in a biblionumber.<br>
You'll then be rewarded by a list of references which were top issued by patrons.<br>
Also results are filtered by their "statisticvalue" because we use this in my Library to fill in subject details (Geography, History, Social Science, etc...) <br>

## To Do
-Integrate into Opac (in progress!)<br>
-Fasten/Optimize query<br>
-Any other idea is welcome<br>
